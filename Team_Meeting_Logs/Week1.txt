Notes from week 1 TA meeting(10/31):
How to divide up work: 
Spilt things in terms of features 
Don’t split just front end/back end etc
Finishing features should be of utmost importance!!!
One week have one group do back end and one group do front end and then the next week swap 
Try to split things into groups of 2ish per feature(pair coding)

These meetings: 
Look at the project guide for what is expected/what we will go over with the TA
Change log: all things worked on during the week, linked in github
Plan for the following week:
All of the things that are going to be done
Each person has at least one thing they are working on for the following week
(can have more per person but not less)
Did everything get done like it was said it would 
Use markdown on github to take these notes (for next time)
Consistent commits → required to make commits to the repository at least 5 days out of the week to get full credit for commits 
Don’t have to make huge commits, a few lines will do 
5 commits per person per week 
Commits need to show/say what you did, not just uploaded files
