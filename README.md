**Application Description:** 

Our application is focused for gamers or people who are looking to get into gaming who need a new game to play. Two of our main focuses for this application to be a simplistic, random game generator, so that users can spend more time gaming and less time deciding what to play. The application will consist of four main pages; a login page, register page, recommendation page and a user page. 
  For our login and register page, we are hoping to implement something similar to past labs, additionally passwords will be encrypted. Initially, we are planning for the application to open up on just the random list of cards of games that users can click through. Prior to logging in the user will not be able to save or like any of the suggestions. If “like” or “save” is clicked and the user is not logged in then the user will be prompted with the login in page. With-in the recommendation page, a single game, with the title, image and other information about the game will be shown. Our main focus is simplicity, and so we are looking for a modern design with only one game shown at a time. Within the recommendation page, the user will only be able to go to the next game, and not be able to go to a previous game.
  We are hoping to create a simplistic application that people interested in gaming can hop on quickly, find a fun, random suggestion and then get back to the game.
